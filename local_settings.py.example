# White list of login user and login ip
# If user and ip not in this list, will send alert
# If blank or not defined will alert any user login from any ip
# Example:
# LOGIN_WHITE_LIST = [
#                      {"user": "foo1", "ip": "123.123.123.123"}, 
#                      {"user": "foo2", "ip": "*"},
#                      {"user": "*", "ip": "124.124.124.124"}
#                    ] 
# In above example:
# user foo1 login from 123.123.123.123 is considered as normal and no alert
# user foo2 login from any ip is considered as normal and no alert
# any user login from 124.124.124.124 is considered as normal and no alert
# NOTES: change LOGIN_WHITE_LIST will auto reload without any reinstall or systemctl restart
LOGIN_WHITE_LIST = []
